This project is about a simple geigercounter for educational purposes. 


# Versions

## V1.0
This is the first version of the geigercounter.
Its only made of the SBM-20 (a russian tube), the powersupply and a little Piezo, for the recognizable clicking sound.

(Todo: add photos)

## V2.0
The second version uses an Arduino nano and a LCD-panel for displaying the average counts per minute (cpm).
